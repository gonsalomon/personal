                <p>EN Hello! I'm Gonzalo, 26 years old.</p>
                <p> I've enrolled in two IT college careers, Ingeniería de Sistemas (dropped due to COVID making it hard without having presential classes) and Tecnicatura Universitaria en Desarrollo de Aplicaciones Informáticas (ongoing).</p>
                <p> My vocation has always been programming, clearly! And after finishing my first year on the second career, I got a job as a Trainee BI Consultant, in We Plan.</p>
                <p> There, I got to learn the basics on Business Intelligence and Data Warehousing, along with plenty of tools used within the BI world.</p>
                <p> We later started specializing into several branches; and while some went into data viz, some into MicroStrategy, I went into data engineering- SSIS, ETL development with Visual Studio along with SSAS, MDM cubes made in Visual Studio as well.</p>
                <p> Later, our training stage was completed, getting into projects as they came into the company. And I got to work as a junior in ETL development as consultant for the CABA government, using plentiful amounts of SQL all around; while continuing to grow in my data warehouse building abilities.</p>
                <p> We also got to train in knowledge on several promptly used tools in the industry, such as Alation (for data catalogs/governance), Soda (for data quality); and in the huge variety of tools there are, specializing in PowerBI -without ignoring the existence of Looker or Tableau.</p>
